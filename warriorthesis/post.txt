Bullying is a serious issue that affects many people of all ages, but it can be especially difficult to deal with when it comes to the lack of friends.

Bullying is a serious issue that can have long-term effects on a person's sense of self-worth and emotional well-being. One type of bullying that is often overlooked is the theft of personal items. It may not seem like a big deal when someone takes something small, like a pencil or a phone charger, but it can be very damaging to the victim.

When someone's personal items are stolen, it can leave them feeling violated and powerless. They may feel like they have no control over their own belongings, or that their privacy has been violated. It can also lead to feelings of insecurity and mistrust of others.
