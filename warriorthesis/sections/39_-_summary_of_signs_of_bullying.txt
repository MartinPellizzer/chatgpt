Bullying is a serious problem that affects many children and adults in our society. It is important to be aware of the signs of bullying so that we can help those who are being bullied. Some signs of bullying include: 

-Physical signs such as bruises, cuts, or other injuries
-Verbal signs such as name-calling, teasing, or threats
-Social signs such as avoiding certain people or activities, or not wanting to go to school
-Emotional signs such as feeling sad, angry, or anxious

It is important to take these signs seriously and to talk to the person who is being bullied. It is also important to talk to the bully and to make sure that the bullying stops. Bullying can have serious consequences for both the bully and the victim, so it is important to address it quickly. If you or someone you know is being bullied, reach out for help. Talk to a teacher, school counselor, or other trusted adult for advice and support.
