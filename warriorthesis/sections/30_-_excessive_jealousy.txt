When it comes to bullying, jealousy can manifest in a variety of ways. It can range from subtle behaviors, such as constantly checking up on their partner, to more obvious and extreme behaviors, such as physical or verbal abuse.

Talk to a trusted friend or family member, or seek professional help. It is also important to communicate with your partner and let them know that their behavior is unacceptable. If the bullying continues, it is important to take the necessary steps to protect yourself.

No one should ever have to experience bullying in a relationship. If you or someone you know is in an unhealthy relationship, take the necessary steps to protect yourself and get the help you need.
