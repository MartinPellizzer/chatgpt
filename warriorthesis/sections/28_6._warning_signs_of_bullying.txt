2. Unexplained absences: If a child or teen begins to miss school or other activities that they normally attend, it could be a sign of bullying. The victim may be avoiding the situation that is causing them distress.

3. Changes in behavior: If a child or teen begins to display changes in behavior such as withdrawal, depression, anger, or anxiety, it could be a sign of bullying.

4. Declining grades: If a child or teen’s grades begin to decline, it could be a sign of bullying. The victim may be too distracted or overwhelmed to focus on their studies.
