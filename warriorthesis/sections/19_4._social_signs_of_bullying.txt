Bullying is a serious issue that can have lasting negative impacts on the victim and the bully. One of the most common forms of bullying is social bullying, which involves using words or actions to hurt or embarrass another person. It’s important to be aware of the social signs of bullying so that you can intervene if necessary.

One of the most common signs of social bullying is exclusion. If you notice that a child is being left out of activities or conversations, or if they are not invited to social events, this could be a sign that they are being socially bullied.

Another sign of social bullying is when someone is being made fun of. If you hear someone making jokes about a person’s appearance, intelligence, or interests, this is a form of social bullying.

It’s also important to be aware of body language. If you notice a person looking away when someone speaks to them, or if they seem uncomfortable around certain people, this could be a sign that they are being socially bullied.

Finally, social bullying can also involve spreading rumors or gossip. If you hear someone spreading false information about another person, this is a form of social bullying.

If you notice any of these signs of social bullying, it’s important to intervene. Talk to the person who is being bullied and offer your support. You can also talk to the bully and explain why their behavior is unacceptable. If the situation persists, it’s important to talk to a school administrator or other adult who can help.
