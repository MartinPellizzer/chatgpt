Making hurtful jokes can be a form of bullying and can be very damaging to those on the receiving end. It can lead to feelings of shame, insecurity, and isolation. Even if the person making the joke doesn't intend to be malicious, their words can still have a lasting impact. It's important to remember that words have power and can cause real harm. If someone makes a joke that you find offensive, it's important to speak up and let them know that their behavior is not acceptable. If you find yourself on the receiving end of a hurtful joke, it's important to take a step back and remember that it's not a reflection of your worth or value. You are worthy of respect and kindness and don't have to put up with anyone who makes you feel otherwise.
