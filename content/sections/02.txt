Using sarcasm to hurt someone is a surefire way to cause lasting damage. It can be used to belittle someone, make them feel inferior, or even to make them feel excluded. Sarcasm often comes off as humorous, but the underlying intent is to hurt the other person. Even if the person being sarcastic doesn't mean to hurt the other person, it can still cause lasting emotional damage. The person on the receiving end may not even realize they are being hurt until it's too late. It's important to be mindful of the words you choose and how they may affect the other person. If you're feeling angry or frustrated, it's better to take a step back and express yourself in a more constructive way.
