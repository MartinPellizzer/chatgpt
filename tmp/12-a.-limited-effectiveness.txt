Ozone sanitization is a method of food safety that uses ozone gas to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Ozone is a naturally occurring gas that is created when oxygen molecules are exposed to ultraviolet light or an electrical current. Ozone is a powerful oxidant, meaning it has the ability to break down organic molecules, including bacteria and viruses. This makes it an effective tool for killing pathogens and preventing food-borne illnesses.

Ozone sanitization has become increasingly popular in the food industry as a way to reduce the risk of food contamination and spoilage. Ozone is used to sanitize food processing equipment, storage containers, and other surfaces that come into contact with food. It can also be used to sanitize water used in food preparation, as well as to treat food waste.

Ozone sanitization is an important part of the food industry's efforts to prevent foodborne illnesses. By using ozone to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, food producers can help ensure that their products are safe for consumption. Additionally, using ozone to sanitize food-related surfaces and equipment can help reduce the spread of food-borne illnesses and keep consumers safe.
