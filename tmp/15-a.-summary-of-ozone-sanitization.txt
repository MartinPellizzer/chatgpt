Ozone sanitization is an effective and safe method of food sanitization used in the food industry. It is a process of disinfecting food and food-related surfaces using ozone, a naturally occurring gas found in the atmosphere. Ozone is a powerful oxidizer and has been used to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms since the late 19th century.

Ozone sanitization is a non-chemical process that does not leave any harmful residues on food, making it a safer alternative to chemical sanitization methods. Ozone sanitization is also more efficient than chemical sanitization, as it kills microorganisms faster and more effectively. Ozone sanitization is especially effective against bacteria, fungi, and viruses, making it a great choice for food processing and storage.
