Ozone sanitization has become an increasingly popular method for food safety in the food industry. Ozone is a naturally occurring gas in the atmosphere that is composed of three oxygen atoms. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and is more effective than chlorine in killing bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.

Ozone sanitization is used to kill foodborne pathogens and other microorganisms on food contact surfaces and in food processing equipment. It is also used to sanitize food packaging materials, including plastic and paper. Ozone sanitization is an environmentally friendly alternative to other sanitization methods, such as chlorine and other chemical treatments.

Ozone sanitization works by breaking down the cell walls of bacteria and other pathogens, killing them in the process. This process is known as oxidation. Ozone sanitization is also effective against mold and yeast, which can cause spoilage and other food safety issues.

Ozone sanitization has become a popular choice for food safety in the food industry due to its effectiveness, safety, and environmental friendliness. It is an important part of a comprehensive food safety program, and is often used in combination with other sanitization methods.
