Ozone Sanitization is a process used in the food industry to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses. Ozone is a naturally occurring gas that has been used for decades to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. It is an effective and environmentally friendly way to keep food safe and free from contamination.

Ozone sanitization works by breaking down the cell walls of microorganisms and destroying their DNA. This process eliminates the risk of foodborne illness and helps to ensure that food is safe to eat. Ozone is also a powerful oxidizer, which means it can break down organic compounds that may be present in food and water.

In the food industry, ozone sanitization is used to keep food and water free from contamination. Ozone is used to sanitize food processing equipment, food storage containers, and food preparation surfaces. It is also used to sanitize water used for food production, such as for irrigation, washing, and processing. Ozone sanitization is also used to sanitize food contact surfaces, such as cutting boards and countertops.
