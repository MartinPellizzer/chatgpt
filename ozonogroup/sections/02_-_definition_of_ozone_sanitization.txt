Ozone sanitization is a process used in the food industry to reduce the risk of food contamination and spoilage. Ozone is a naturally occurring gas that is created when oxygen molecules are exposed to ultraviolet light. It is a powerful oxidant and has been used as a sanitizing agent in the food industry for over a century.

Ozone sanitization is a process that uses ozone gas to kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi on food surfaces. Ozone is highly reactive, which means it can quickly break down organic molecules and oxidize them, destroying the pathogens that cause food-borne illnesses. It is also effective against a wide variety of food-borne pathogens, including Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria.

Ozone sanitization has many advantages over traditional chemical sanitization methods. It does not leave any toxic residues on food surfaces, and it does not require the use of harsh chemicals. It is also a very cost-effective method of sanitization, as it can be used on a wide variety of surfaces, including food-contact surfaces, and it does not require the use of specialized equipment.

Ozone sanitization is an effective and safe method of sanitizing food surfaces, and it is becoming increasingly popular in the food industry. It is an important part of an overall food safety program, and it can help to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses.
