The food industry is increasingly turning to ozone sanitization as a way to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses and contamination. Ozone is a powerful disinfectant that can kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. However, there are some challenges associated with ozone sanitization in the food industry that must be addressed in order to ensure food safety.

One of the main challenges of ozone sanitization in the food industry is that ozone can react with certain organic compounds in food, resulting in the formation of potentially harmful by-products. These by-products can be toxic and can even cause cancer in humans. Therefore, it is important to ensure that ozone sanitization is done in the right concentration and for the right amount of time in order to minimize the formation of these by-products.

Another challenge of ozone sanitization in the food industry is that ozone is a highly reactive gas and can be difficult to contain and control. Ozone needs to be used in a contained environment and must be monitored closely to ensure that the ozone levels remain within safe limits. If the ozone levels become too high, it can be hazardous to the health of workers and consumers.

Finally, ozone sanitization is a relatively expensive process and requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. This can be a challenge for smaller food businesses that may not have the resources to invest in ozone sanitization.

Overall, ozone sanitization can be a powerful tool for reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses and contamination. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges associated with ozone sanitization in the food industry in order to ensure that the process is done safely and effectively.
