Ozone sanitization is a powerful and effective method of sanitizing food and food-contact surfaces in the food industry. Ozone, or O3, is a naturally occurring gas that is created when oxygen molecules (O2) are exposed to an electrical charge. When ozone is applied to food or food-contact surfaces, it oxidizes any bacteria, viruses, and fungi that may be present. This oxidation process destroys the cell walls of the microorganisms, rendering them unable to reproduce and causing them to die.

Ozone sanitization is a safe and effective method of sanitizing food and food-contact surfaces. It is a fast and efficient way to reduce the presence of harmful pathogens in food, and it does not leave any chemical residue behind. Ozone sanitization is also more cost-effective than traditional chemical sanitization methods.

In the food industry, ozone sanitization is most commonly used to sanitize surfaces, equipment, and food products. To sanitize surfaces and equipment, ozone is introduced into the air of a room or enclosure, and the ozone molecules attach to any bacteria, viruses, or fungi present. The ozone then oxidizes the microorganisms, killing them and preventing them from reproducing. For sanitizing food products, ozone is typically applied to the food in the form of a mist or fog. The ozone molecules attach to the food and oxidize any microorganisms present.

Ozone sanitization is an effective and safe way to sanitize food and food-contact surfaces in the food industry. It is a fast and cost-effective way to reduce the presence of harmful pathogens in food, and it does not leave any chemical residue behind. For these reasons, ozone sanitization is becoming increasingly popular in the food industry.
