Ozone sanitization is becoming increasingly popular in the food industry as a way to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses. Ozone sanitization is a process that uses ozone gas to kill bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens on food surfaces and in food processing environments. While ozone sanitization is a powerful tool for food safety, it is not without its issues. In this blog, we will discuss some of the common issues with ozone sanitization.

One of the main issues with ozone sanitization is that it can be difficult to measure and control the concentration of ozone being used. Ozone is a powerful oxidant, and if the concentration is too high, it can damage food surfaces and equipment. It is important to use the correct concentration of ozone to ensure that it is effective at killing pathogens without causing damage.

Another issue with ozone sanitization is that it is not effective against all types of pathogens. Ozone is effective at killing bacteria and viruses, but it is not effective against some foodborne parasites, such as protozoa. If these parasites are present in a food processing environment, other methods of sanitization must be used.

Finally, ozone sanitization can be expensive. Ozone generators and other equipment used in the process can be expensive to purchase and maintain. Additionally, the process can be labor-intensive, as it requires careful monitoring and control of the ozone concentration.

While ozone sanitization can be an effective tool for food safety, it is important to be aware of the common issues associated with it. Careful monitoring and control of the ozone concentration is essential to ensure the process is effective and safe. Additionally, other methods of sanitization may need to be used if certain foodborne parasites are present.
