The food industry is highly regulated by the government, and the use of ozone sanitization is no exception. Ozone sanitization is a powerful tool for food safety and has the potential to significantly reduce foodborne illness. However, it is important to understand the regulations and guidelines for ozone sanitization in the food industry in order to ensure safe and effective use.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established regulations for ozone sanitization in the food industry. These regulations include requirements for the use of ozone, such as the concentration of ozone used, the contact time required, and the temperature of the food product. Additionally, the FDA requires that ozone sanitization be performed in a properly ventilated area, and that all ozone-treated food products be tested for residual ozone before they are released for sale.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also has guidelines for ozone sanitization in the food industry. These guidelines recommend the use of ozone as an effective sanitizing agent, and provide guidance on the proper use and maintenance of ozone-generating equipment. Additionally, the USDA recommends that ozone-treated food products be tested for residual ozone before they are released for sale.

In addition to the regulations and guidelines from the FDA and USDA, many states and local governments have their own regulations and guidelines for ozone sanitization in the food industry. It is important to be aware of these regulations and guidelines when using ozone sanitization in your food production process.

By following the regulations and guidelines for ozone sanitization in the food industry, you can ensure that your food production process is safe and effective. Ozone sanitization is a powerful tool for food safety and can help reduce the risk of foodborne illness.
